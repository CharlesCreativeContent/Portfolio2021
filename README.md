My learning was focused on the changing of the source of an image element, and techniques to make a standard size for non-standard images. Worked very well for desktop, but the mobile version still needs some media qeuries

## Optimizations

I would have made a container for the objects that could have resized each image automatically rather than writing a function that updates the size and location after rendering. It got the job done, but was overly cumbersome to update and add more features. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that when I am writing custom functions and corrections for each individual element, I should definitely keep an eye out for techniques, strategies, or, frameworks, that could make my work more scalable and optimized.
